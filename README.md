# Research Site Template

[See the Demo Here](https://maxturer.github.io/research-site)

## A template for a single research project, adapted from [al-folio](https://alshedivat.github.io/al-folio/)

## Installing

1. Click on the "Use this template" button on the top right, and follow the instructions to create your own repository.
2. Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens and choose Generate New Token (classic is fine). Name it what you like (I used the same name as the repository I made in step 1), and copy the generated code (keep it pasted somewhere safe).
3. Back in your new repository, go to Settings --> Secrets --> Actions, and create a new Secret called LIGHTHOUSE_BADGER_TOKEN. Paste the code you just copied here as the "Value."
4. In your new repository, go to Settings --> Actions --> General, and make sure "Read and Write Permissions" is checked in the "Workflow Permissions" section. Check it if not, and save.
6. Next, go to Settings --> Pages. Choose "Deploy from a branch" as your build source (use your "main" or "master" branch for now).
5. Open the file _config.yml. Change the url from maxturer.github.io to [your username].github.io, and change the base url from /research-site/ to the name of your new repository (like: /new-repo-name/).
6. After a few minutes, head back to Settings --> Pages. The "deploy from a branch" dropdown should have a new branch available called "gh-pages." Choose this one instead, and save.
7. Wait (a while) for the action to run, then you should have your site! Customize as you like.
